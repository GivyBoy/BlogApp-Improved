# Portfolio Optimization web app deployed on Heroku

In this project, I examine whether the MPT is still applicable today and if it can outperform a buy and hold, stock-based, equal-weighted portfolio. I show that the MPT portfolio, based on the Efficient Frontier, consistently outperforms the equal-weighted portfolio and the S&P500, no matter the inputs.

The deployed web app is live at: https://portfolio-optimizationapp.herokuapp.com/



The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* datetime
